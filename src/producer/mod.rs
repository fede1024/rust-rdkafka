//! Kafka producers.
//!
//! ## The C librdkafka producer
//!
//! Rust-rdkafka relies on the C librdkafka producer to communicate with Kafka,
//! so in order to understand how the Rust producers work it is important to
//! understand the basics of the C one as well.
//!
//! ### Async
//!
//! The librdkafka producer is completely asynchronous: it maintains a memory
//! buffer where messages waiting to be sent or currently in flight are stored.
//! Once a message is delivered or an error occurred and the maximum number of
//! retries has been reached, the producer will enqueue a delivery event with
//! the appropriate delivery result into an internal event queue.
//!
//! The librdkafka user is responsible for calling the `poll` function at
//! regular intervals to process those events; the thread calling `poll` will be
//! the one executing the user-specified delivery callback for every delivery
//! event. If `poll` is not called, or not frequently enough, the producer will
//! return a [`RDKafkaErrorCode::QueueFull`] error and it won't be able to send
//! any other message until more delivery events are processed via `poll`. The
//! `QueueFull` error can also be returned if Kafka is not able to receive the
//! messages quickly enough.
//!
//! ### Error reporting
//!
//! The C library will try deal with all the transient errors such as broker
//! disconnection, timeouts etc. These errors, called global errors, are
//! automatically logged in rust-rdkafka, but they normally don't require any
//! handling as they are automatically handled internally. To see the logs, make
//! sure you initialize the logger.
//!
//! As mentioned earlier, errors specific to message production will be reported
//! in the delivery callback.
//!
//! ### Buffering
//!
//! Buffering is done automatically by librdkafka. When `send` is called, the
//! message is enqueued internally and once enough messages have been enqueued,
//! or when enough time has passed, they will be sent to Kafka as a single
//! batch. You can control the behavior of the buffer by configuring the the
//! `queue.buffering.max.*` parameters listed below.
//!
//! ## `rust-rdkafka` producers
//!
//! `rust-rdkafka` (rdkafka for brevity) provides two sets of producers: low
//! level and high level.
//!
//! ### Low-level producers
//!
//! The lowest level producer provided by rdkafka is called [`BaseProducer`].
//! The goal of the `BaseProducer` is to be as close as possible to the C one
//! while maintaining a safe Rust interface. In particular, the `BaseProducer`
//! needs to be polled at regular intervals to execute any delivery callback
//! that might be waiting and to make sure the queue doesn't fill up.
//!
//! Another low lever producer is the [`ThreadedProducer`], which is a
//! `BaseProducer` with a dedicated thread for polling.
//!
//! The delivery callback can be defined using a `ProducerContext`. See the
//! [`base_producer`] module for more information.
//!
//! ### High-level producer
//!
//! At the moment the only high level producer implemented is the
//! [`FutureProducer`]. The `FutureProducer` doesn't rely on user-defined
//! callbacks to notify the delivery or failure of a message; instead, this
//! information will be returned in a Future. The `FutureProducer` also uses an
//! internal thread that is used for polling, which makes calling poll
//! explicitly not necessary. The returned future will contain information about
//! the delivered message in case of success, or a copy of the original message
//! in case of failure. Additional computation can be chained to the returned
//! future, and it will executed by the future executor once the value is
//! available (for more information, check the documentation of the futures
//! crate).
//!
//! ## Transactions
//!
//! All rust-rdkafka producers support transactions. Transactional producers
//! work together with transaction-aware consumers configured with the default
//! `isolation.level` of `read_committed`.
//!
//! To configure a producer for transactions set `transactional.id` to an
//! identifier unique to the application when creating the producer. After
//! creating the producer, you must initialize it with
//! [`Producer::init_transactions`].
//!
//! To start a new transaction use [`Producer::begin_transaction`]. There can be
//! **only one ongoing transaction** at a time per producer. All records sent
//! after starting a transaction and before committing or aborting it will
//! automatically be associated with that transaction.
//!
//! Once you have initialized transactions on a producer, you are not permitted
//! to produce messages outside of a transaction.
//!
//! Consumer offsets can be sent as part of the ongoing transaction using
//! `send_offsets_to_transaction` and will be committed atomically with the
//! other records sent in the transaction.
//!
//! The current transaction can be committed with
//! [`Producer::commit_transaction`] or aborted using
//! [`Producer::abort_transaction`]. Afterwards, a new transaction can begin.
//!
//! ### Errors
//!
//! Errors returned by transaction methods may:
//!
//! * be retriable ([`RDKafkaError::is_retriable`]), in which case the operation
//!   that encountered the error may be retried.
//! * require abort ([`RDKafkaError::txn_requires_abort`], in which case the
//!   current transaction must be aborted and a new transaction begun.
//! * be fatal ([`RDKafkaError::is_fatal`]), in which case the producer must be
//!   stopped and the application terminated.
//!
//! For more details about transactions, see the [Transactional Producer]
//! section of the librdkafka introduction.
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! ### Producer configuration
//!
//! For the configuration parameters common to both producers and consumers,
//! refer to the documentation in the `config` module. Here are listed the most
//! commonly used producer configuration. Click
//! [here](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md)
//! for the full list.
//!
//! - `queue.buffering.max.messages`: Maximum number of messages allowed on the
//!   producer queue. Default: 100000.
//! - `queue.buffering.max.kbytes`: Maximum total message size sum allowed on
//!   the producer queue. This property has higher priority than
//!   queue.buffering.max.messages. Default: 4000000.
//! - `queue.buffering.max.ms`: Delay in milliseconds to wait for messages in
//!   the producer queue to accumulate before sending a request to the brokers.
//!   A higher value allows larger and more effective (less overhead, improved
//!   compression) batches of messages to accumulate at the expense of increased
//!   message delivery latency. Default: 0.
//! - `message.send.max.retries`: How many times to retry sending a failing
//!   batch. Note: retrying may cause reordering. Default: 2.
//! - `compression.codec`: Compression codec to use for compressing message
//!   sets. Default: none.
//! - `request.required.acks`: This field indicates how many acknowledgements
//!   the leader broker must receive from ISR brokers before responding to the
//!   request: 0=Broker does not send any response/ack to client, 1=Only the
//!   leader broker will need to ack the message, -1 or all=broker will block
//!   until message is committed by all in sync replicas (ISRs) or broker's
//!   in.sync.replicas setting before sending response. Default: 1.
//! - `request.timeout.ms`: The ack timeout of the producer request in
//!   milliseconds. This value is only enforced by the broker and relies on
//!   request.required.acks being != 0. Default: 5000.
//! - `message.timeout.ms`: Local message timeout. This value is only enforced
//!   locally and limits the time a produced message waits for successful
//!   delivery. A time of 0 is infinite. Default: 300000.
