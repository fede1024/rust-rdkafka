# rdkafka-sys

Low level bindings to [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka).

## Bindings

To regenerate the bindings:

``` bash
git submodule update --init
cargo install bindgen
./update-bindings.sh
```

## Version

The rdkafka-sys version number is in the format `X.Y.Z-P`, where `X.Y.Z`
corresponds to the librdkafka version, and `P` indicates the version of the
rust bindings.

## Build

### Known issues

* When any of librdkafka's optional dependencies are enabled, like libz or
  OpenSSL, if you have multiple versions of that library installed upon your
  system, librdkafka's build system may disagree with Cargo about which version
  of the library to use! **This can result in subtly broken builds,** if
  librdkafka compiles against the headers for one version but Cargo links
  against a different version.  For complete confidence when building release
  binaries, use an environment like a Docker container or a chroot jail where
  you can guarantee that only one version of each dependency is present.
  Unfortunately, the current design of Cargo makes this nearly impossible to
  fix.

* librdkafka's default build system, which uses a bespoke tool called mklove, is
  somewhat unreliable, as enabling optional features is best-effort. If a
  required dependency for an optional feature is not found, the feature will be
  silently disabled ([details][mklove-bug]). **Using the CMake based build
  system is strongly encouraged**, if you can take the dependency on CMake.

### Features

By default a submodule with the librdkafka sources pinned to a specific commit
will be used to compile and statically link the library.

The **`dynamic-linking`** feature can be used to link rdkafka to a locally
installed version of librdkafka: if the feature is enabled, the build script
will use `pkg-config` to check the version of the library installed in the
system, and it will configure the compiler to dynamically link against it.

The **`cmake-build`** feature builds librdkafka with its [CMake] build system,
rather than its default [mklove]-based build system. This feature requires that
CMake is installed on the build machine.

The following features directly correspond to librdkafka features (i.e., flags
you would pass to `configure` if you were compiling manually).

  * The **`ssl`** feature enables SSL support. By default, the system's OpenSSL
    library is dynamically linked, but static linking of the version bundled
    with the openssl-sys crate can be requested with the `ssl-vendored` feature.
  * The **`gssapi`** feature enables SASL GSSAPI support with Cyrus libsasl2.
    This feature requires that libsasl2 is installed on the system, as there is
    not yet a libsasl2-sys crate that can build and link against a bundled
    copy of the library.
  * The **`libz`** feature enables support for zlib compression. This
    feature is enabled by default. By default, the system's libz is dynamically
    linked, but static linking of the version bundled with the libz-sys crate
    can be requested with the `libz-static` feature.
  * The **`zstd`** feature enables support for ZSTD compression. By default,
    this builds and statically links the version bundled with the zstd-sys
    crate, but dynamic linking of the system's version can be requested with the
    `zstd-pkg-config` feature.
  * The **`external-lz4`** feature statically links against the copy of liblz4
    bundled with the lz4-sys crate. By default, librdkafka statically links
    against its own bundled version of liblz4. Due to limitations with lz4-sys,
    it is not yet possible to dynamically link against the system's version of
    liblz4.
  * The **`musl`** feature statically links against the musl libc library

All features are disabled by default unless noted otherwise above. The build
process is defined in [`build.rs`](build.rs).

## Updating

To upgrade change the git submodule in `librdkafka`, check if new errors
need to be added to `helpers::primive_to_rd_kafka_resp_err_t` and update
the version in `Cargo.toml`.
