# rdkafka-sys

Low level bindings to [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka),
a C library for the [Apache Kafka] protocol with producer, consumer, and
admin clients.

For a safe wrapper, see the [rdkafka] crate.

## Version

The rdkafka-sys version number is in the format `X.Y.Z+RX.RY.RZ`, where
`X.Y.Z` is the version of this crate and follows SemVer conventions, while
`RX.RY.RZ` is the version of the bundled librdkafka.

Note that versions before v2.0.0+1.4.2 did not follow this convention, and
instead directly correspond to the bundled librdkafka version.

## Build

### Known issues

* When any of librdkafka's optional dependencies are enabled, like libz or
  OpenSSL, if you have multiple versions of that library installed upon your
  system, librdkafka's build system may disagree with Cargo about which
  version of the library to use! **This can result in subtly broken
  builds,** if librdkafka compiles against the headers for one version but
  Cargo links against a different version.  For complete confidence when
  building release binaries, use an environment like a Docker container or a
  chroot jail where you can guarantee that only one version of each
  dependency is present. The current design of Cargo unfortunately makes
  this nearly impossible to fix.

* Windows builds always use the CMake build system, regardless of whether
  the `cmake-build` Cargo feature is enabled or not. This is because Windows
  is only supported with CMake as the build system.

### Features

By default a submodule with the librdkafka sources will be used to compile
and statically link the library.

The **`dynamic-linking`** feature can be used to link rdkafka to a locally
installed version of librdkafka: if the feature is enabled, the build script
will use `pkg-config` to check the version of the library installed in the
system, and it will configure the compiler to dynamically link against it.
The system version of librdkafka must exactly match the version of
librdkafka bundled with this crate.

The **`cmake-build`** feature builds librdkafka with its [CMake] build
system, rather than its default [mklove]-based build system. This feature
requires that CMake is installed on the build machine.

The following features directly correspond to librdkafka features (i.e.,
flags you would pass to `configure` if you were compiling manually).

  * The **`ssl`** feature enables SSL support. By default, the system's
    OpenSSL library is dynamically linked, but static linking of the version
    bundled with the [openssl-sys] crate can be requested with the
    `ssl-vendored` feature.
  * The **`gssapi`** feature enables SASL GSSAPI support with Cyrus
    libsasl2. By default the system's libsasl2 is dynamically linked, but
    static linking of the version bundled with the [sasl2-sys] crate can be
    requested with the `gssapi-vendored` feature.
  * The **`libz`** feature enables support for zlib compression. This
    feature is enabled by default. By default, the system's libz is
    dynamically linked, but static linking of the version bundled with the
    [libz-sys] crate can be requested with the `libz-static` feature.
  * The **`curl`** feature enables the HTTP client via curl. By default, the
    system's curl is dynamically linked, but static linking of the version
    bundled with the [curl-sys] create can be requested with the
    `curl-static` feature.
  * The **`zstd`** feature enables support for ZSTD compression. By default,
    this builds and statically links the version bundled with the [zstd-sys]
    crate, but dynamic linking of the system's version can be requested with
    the `zstd-pkg-config` feature.
  * The **`external-lz4`** feature statically links against the copy of
    liblz4 bundled with the [lz4-sys] crate. By default, librdkafka
    statically links against its own bundled version of liblz4. Due to
    limitations with lz4-sys, it is not yet possible to dynamically link
    against the system's version of liblz4.

All features are disabled by default unless noted otherwise above. The build
process is defined in [`build.rs`].
