# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v4.5.0+1.9.2 (2023-06-09)

* Add support for the cluster mock API.

## v4.4.0+1.9.2 (2023-05-12)

* Add the `RDKafkaDeleteGroup` and `RDKafkaGroupResult` type aliases to the
  `types` module.

## v4.3.0+1.9.2 (2022-10-29)

* Upgrade to librdkafka v1.9.2.

* Support building outside of Cargo, where the `CARGO_MAKEFLAGS` environment
  variable is unlikely to be set. The build script would previously panic if
  `CARGO_MAKEFLAGS` was not set.

## v4.2.0+1.8.2 (2021-11-27)

* Upgrade to librdkafka v1.8.2.

## v4.1.0+1.7.0 (2021-10-16)

* Upgrade to librdkafka v1.7.0.

## v4.0.0+1.6.1 (2021-03-16)

* **Breaking change.** Mark the `RDKafkaErrorCode` enum as [non-exhaustive], so
  that future additions to the enum will not be considered breaking changes.

* Upgrade to librdkafka v1.6.1.

## v3.0.0+1.6.0 (2021-01-30)

* **Breaking change.** Rename `RDKafkaError` to `RDKafkaErrorCode`. This makes
  space for the new `RDKafkaError` type, which mirrors the `rd_kafka_error_t`
  type added to librdkafka in v1.4.0.

  This change was made to reduce long-term confusion by ensuring the types in
  rust-rdkafka map to types in librdkafka as directly as possible. The
  maintainers apologize for the difficulty in upgrading through this change.

* Upgrade to librdkafka v1.6.0.

* Enforce a minimum zstd-sys version of 1.4.19. This bumps the vendored version
  of libzstd to at least v1.4.8, which avoids a bug in libzstd v1.4.5 that could
  cause decompression failures ([edenhill/librdkafka#2672]).

## v2.1.1+1.5.3 (2021-01-05)

* Yanked due to an inadvertent breaking change.

## v2.1.0+1.5.0 (2020-08-02)

* Upgrade to librdkafka v1.5.0.

## v2.0.0+1.4.2 (2020-07-08)

* Start separate changelog for rdkafka-sys.

* Upgrade to librdkafka v1.4.2.

* Correct several references to `usize` in the generated bindings to `size_t`.
